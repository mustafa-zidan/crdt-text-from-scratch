# CRDT Text Editor: From Scratch to Reality

> A hands-on project to build a sequence CRDT for collaborative text editing from scratch and  benchmark it.
> This is an attempt to understand the principles of CRDTs and their practical applications in real-time collaborative systems.

## Purpose

This project is a personal learning journey into the world of CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types) in the context of real-time collaborative applications.
