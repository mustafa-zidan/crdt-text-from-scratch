> - "CRDT for collaborative text editing"
> - "Logoot vs RGA vs LSEQ"
> - "Automerge internal structure"
> - "JSON CRDTs"
> - "Undoable CRDT"

### Your goal:
- Document at least 2 advanced or hybrid types
- Explain what problems they solve (e.g., sequences, nesting, rich documents)
- Mention design choices (positioning logic, tombstones, garbage collection)
- Optional: diagrams of how they order elements

### Reading suggestions:
- [Logoot paper](https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00432368/document)
- [Automerge docs](https://automerge.org/docs/)
- [Yjs architecture](https://docs.yjs.dev/overview/architecture)

## Use Cases by Model Type

> Search for:
> - "CRDTs in real-world apps"
> - "offline first architecture"
> - "real-time sync CRDT"

### Your goal:
- For each CRDT type, list what real-world scenarios it fits best
- Bonus: find *actual tools* or databases that use it (e.g., Redis, Automerge, Yjs, Riak)
